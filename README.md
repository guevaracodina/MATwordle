Guess the hidden word in 6 tries. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. Hit the enter button to input. After each guess, the color of the letters will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

If the letter is green, then it is in the word and in the correct spot.

If the letter is orange, then it is in the word but in the wrong spot.

If the letter is black, then it is not in the word in any spot.
